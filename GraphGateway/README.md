# Graph Gateway

## Setup
Manual supergraph composition is requred when ever any of the subgraphs change. Automation of this is coming soon.
- ``` > npm install -g rover ```
- ``` > rover supergraph compose --config ./supergraph-config.yaml --log debug ```
- ``` cut & paste results below the 'CoreShema:' into supergraph.graphql (note: do not copy any debug statements if running logging) ```
